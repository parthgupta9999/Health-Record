# Health-Record
The "Person Identification through Webcam and Medical History Display" project utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to identify individuals through a webcam on a website. 
The system employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for accurate person recognition. Once a person is identified, their medical history is displayed on the screen.
Additionally, the project leverages Google Text-to-Speech technology to generate voice output of the medical records, ensuring accessibility for individuals with visual impairments.
By combining computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing, this project provides a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for person identification and medical history retrieval. It enhances the efficiency and accessibility of healthcare systems by automating the identification process and enabling voice-based access to medical records.
